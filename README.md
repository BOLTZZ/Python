# Python
Hi, my name is Ojas and you've found my Python repository. Here I have some Python syntax and functions explained. Also, I have Python projects and explain the code in it. Check out my [Asteroid game](https://github.com/BOLTZZ/Asteroid-Game) and my [Chrome Dinosaur game](). If you're just starting to code check out my [How To Get Started Guide](https://github.com/BOLTZZ/Python/blob/master/How%20To%20Get%20Started%20Guide.md)
