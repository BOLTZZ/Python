2. Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 1,000 which have a digit of the user's number.
3. Count the number of spaces in an inputted string.
4. Takes in a string and removes all the vowels.
5. Takes in a list of words and finds which words' number of characters are equal to or less than the user's number.
