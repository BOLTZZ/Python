# Magic With Files:
As explained before this program does a multitude of things:
* Takes n as an inut from the user and reads the first n lines of the file.
* Takes n as an input from the user and reads the last n lines of the file.
* Finds the longest word or words. Words are defined if they have spaces between them, using this logic, a link could constitute as a word.
* Takes a word input from the user and finds the frequency of that word in the file. This is case-sensitive (so sheldon is not the same as Sheldon).
* Prints every single word in the file and the frequency of that word in the file (this creates an user dictionary). Also, don't worry there aren't repeats. 
* Prints the word(s) with the most vowels.
* Prints the word(s) with the least vowels.
